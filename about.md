# About the blog

Marcel is an IT systems engineer who likes implementing, integrating and automating solutions that make the job easier for colleagues and customers.

One of Marcel's key motivation is to improve how his company and team works in order to be more efficient so the team can focus on interesting tasks.

After about ten years of experience as a Windows systems engineer (including a few years working with Citrix XenDesktop) as an internal for different companies, Marcel switched to a service company which provides managed network, security and storage services. There, he manages the Operations & Support team, helps streamlining the operations and improving automation.

For hobbies, Marcel loves a quiet evening with a book or netflixing, a round of craft beers with friends, traveling to remote places, scuba diving, motorcycling, photography, mountain hiking and more.
